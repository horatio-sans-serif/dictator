BRIAN (00:20):
  So what do you got going on today?

KATIE (00:21):
  I have gym and we're starting a new unit.
  I have to take my Social Studies test today.

BRIAN (00:26):
  What's that on?

KATIE (00:27):
  law terms

BRIAN (00:28):
  Due Process?

KATIE (00:30):
  Yeah like law terms.

KATIE (00:26):
  And um, I studied with Mommy last night and she said she would give me a 90 on it.

KATIE (00:40):
  And there is a lot of extra credit

BRIAN (00:44):
  You never changed your bra.
  OK

KATIE (00:49):
  I'm sorry.
  Oh, no, I have to get on the bus.

BRIAN (00:54):
  No, you don't.
  You're not wearing a bra to school Katie.
  That's not happening.
  We talked about this months ago.
  That doesn't change right now just because you are going to miss the bus.

BRIAN (1:11):
  I will just drive you. It's no big deal.
  But try to..
  You gotta get off the phone entirely I think baby OK.
  When I have other things do the phone can't be involved.
  I think it's really that simple.
  I really do.
  Alright.
  No. Really, just... No phone in the morning.
  No phone before, really, homework.
  It's too much.
  The signs are all there.
  It's like over and over again the same thing.
  We just have to adjust.

KATIE (1:40):
  OK
  I'll be right back.

BRIAN (1:41):
  Yup.
