KATIE (00:07):
  Daddy what are you up to today?

BRIAN (00:10):
  Uh, I got a lot of work to do today.

KATIE (00:13):
  Oh I'm sorry.

BRIAN (00:15):
  That's OK. That's why I get paid!
  Uh, we're going to drive, right?
  So I'll get my car?

KATIE (00:19):
  Yeah

BRIAN (00:29):
  We gotta get going though.
  It's 7:30 already

KATIE (00:30):
  I know.
